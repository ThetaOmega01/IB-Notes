\subsection{Topological surfaces}
Let's start with a definition.
\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{topological surface} is a topological space $ \Sigma $ such that 
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item $ \forall \rho\in \Sigma $, there is an open neighbourhood $\rho\in U \subset \Sigma$ such that $U$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$, or a disc $D^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$, with its usual Euclidean topology. 
        \item $\Sigma$ is Hausdorff and second countable. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
        \item Write $ \cong $ for homeomorphic, $ \mathbb{R}^{2} \cong D^2(0,1) = \{x\in \mathbb{R}^{2}: \left\| x \right\|<1\} $

        \item A space $X$ is Hausdorff if for $p\neq q$ in $X$, there exists disjoint open sets $U\ni p, V\ni q$ in $X$. 
        A space is second countable if it has a countable base, i.e. there exists $ \{U_i\}_{i\in \mathbb{N}} $ open sets such that every open set is a union of some $U_i$. (a) is the point and (b) is for technical honesty.
             
        \item If $X$ is Hausdorff or second countable, so are subspaces of $X$. Euclidean space has these properties. To see it is second countable, consider open balls $B(c,r)$ with $c\in \mathbb{Q}^n$ and $r\in \mathbb{Q}_+$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $ \mathbb{R}^{2}$ the plane. 
        \item Any open set in $ \mathbb{R}^{2}$, i.e. $ \mathbb{R}^{2}\setminus Z $ where $Z$ is closed, e.g. $ Z = \{0\} $ or $ Z = \{(0,0) \cup (0,\frac{1}{n}), n=1,2,\dots\} $. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Let \( f \colon \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R \) be a continuous function.
	The graph of \( f \), denoted \( \Gamma_f \), is defined by
	\[
		\Gamma_f = \qty{(x,y,f(x,y)) \colon (x,y) \in \mathbb R^2}
	\]
	with the subspace topology when embedded in \( \mathbb R^3 \).

	Recall that a product topology \( X \times Y \) has the feature that \( f \colon Z \to X \times Y \) is continuous if and only if \( \pi_x \circ f \colon Z \to X \) and \( \pi_y \circ f \colon Z \to Y \) are continuous.

	Hence, any graph \( \Gamma \subseteq X \times Y \) is homeomorphic to \( X \) if \( f \) is continuous.
	Indeed, the projection \( \pi_x \) projects each point in the graph onto the domain.
	The function \( s \colon x \mapsto (x,f(x)) \) is continuous by the above.
	In particular, in our case, the graph \( \Gamma_f \) is homeomorphic to \( \mathbb R^2 \), which we know is a topological surface.
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
	As a topological surface, \( \Gamma_f \) is independent of the function \( f \).
	However, we will later introduce more ways to describe topological spaces that will ascribe new properties to \( \Gamma_f \) which do depend on \( f \).
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
	The sphere:
	\[
		S^2 = \qty{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb R^3 \colon x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1}
	\]
	is a topological surface, when using the subspace topology in \( \mathbb R^3 \).
	Consider the stereographic projection of \( S^2 \) onto \( \mathbb R^2 \) from the north pole \( (0,0,1) \).
	The projection satisfies \( \pi_+ \colon S^2 \setminus \qty{(0,0,1)} \) and
	\[
		(x,y,z) \mapsto \qty(\frac{x}{1-z}, \frac{y}{1-z})
	\]
	Certainly, \( \pi_+ \) is continuous, since we do not consider the point \( (0,0,1) \) to be in its domain.
	The inverse map is given by
	\[
		(u,v) \mapsto \qty(\frac{2u}{u^2+v^2+1}, \frac{2v}{u^2+v^2+1}, \frac{u^2+v^2-1}{u^2+v^2+1})
	\]
	This is also a continuous function.
	Hence \( \pi_+ \) is a homeomorphism.
	Similarly, we can construct the stereographic projection from the south pole, \( \pi_- \) defined by 
    \[
        (x,y,z) \mapsto \left( \frac{x}{1+z},\frac{y}{1+z} \right). 
    \]
	This is a homeomorphism.
	Hence, every point in \( S^2 \) lies either in the domain of \( \pi_+ \) or \( \pi_- \), and hence sits in an open set \( S^2 \setminus \qty{(0,0,1)} \) or \( S^2 \setminus \qty{(0,0,-1)} \) which is homeomorphic to \( \mathbb R^2 \).
\end{example}
\begin{note}
	\( S^2 \) is compact by the Heine-Borel theorem, that is, it is a closed bounded set in \( \mathbb R^3 \).
\end{note}

\begin{example}
	The real projective plane is a topological surface.
	The group \( \mathbb Z / 2 \) acts on \( S^2 \) by homeomorphisms via the \textbf{antipodal map} \( a \colon S^2 \to S^2 \), mapping \( \mathbf{x} \mapsto -\mathbf x \).
	There exists a homeomorphism \( \mathbb Z / 2 \) to the group \( \mathrm{Homeo}(S^2) \) of homeomorphisms of \( S^2 \), by mapping \( 1 + \mathbb Z \mapsto a \).

	We now define the real projective plane to be the quotient of \( S^2 \) given by identifying every point \( \mathbf x \) with its image \( -\mathbf x \) under \( a \).
	\[
		\mathbb R \mathbb P^2 = \faktor{S^2}{\mathbb Z/2} = \faktor{S^2}{\sim};\quad \mathbf{x} \sim a(\mathbf{x})
	\]
	\begin{lemma}
		\( \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \) bijects with the set of straight lines in \( \mathbb R^3 \) through the origin.
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
		Any line through the origin intersects \( S^2 \) exactly in a pair of antipodal points \( \mathbf{x}, -\mathbf{x} \).
		Similarly, pairs of antipodal points uniquely define a line through the origin.
	\end{proof}
	\begin{lemma}
		\( \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \) is a topological surface with the quotient topology.
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
		First check that \( \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \) is Hausdorff since it is constructed by a quotient, not a subspace.
		If \( X \) is a space and \( q \colon X \to Y \) is a quotient map, then by definition \( V \subset Y \) is open if and only if \( q^{-1}(V) \subset X \) is open.
		If \( [\mathbf p] \neq [\mathbf q] \in \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \), then \( \pm \mathbf p, \pm \mathbf q \in S^2 \) are distinct antipodal pairs.
		We can therefore construct distinct open discs around \( \mathbf p, \mathbf q \) in \( S^2 \), and their antipodal images.
		These uniquely define open neighbourhoods of \( [\mathbf p], [\mathbf q] \), which are disjoint.

		Similarly, we can check that \( \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \) is second countable.
		We know that \( S^2 \) is second countable, so let \( \mathcal U \) be a countable base for the topology on \( S^2 \).
		Without loss of generality, we can assert that for all sets \( U \in \mathcal U \), we have \( -U \in \mathcal U \).
		Let \( \overline{\mathcal U} \) be the family of open sets in \( \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \) of the form \( q(U) \cup q(-U) \) for \( U \in \mathcal U \), where \( q \) is the quotient map.
		Now, if \( V \subseteq \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \) is open, then by definition \( q^{-1}(V) \) is open in \( S^2 \) hence \( q^{-1}(V) \) contains some \( U \in \mathcal U \) and hence contains \( U \cup (-U) \).
		Hence \( \overline{\mathcal U} \) is a countable base for the quotient topology on \( \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \).

		Finally, let \( \mathbf p \in S^2 \) and \( [\mathbf p] \in \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \) its image.
		Let \( \overline D \) be a small (contained in an open hemisphere) closed disc, which is a neighbourhood of \( \mathbf p \in S^2 \).
		The quotient map restricted to \( \overline D \), written \( q\restriction_{\overline D} \colon \overline D \to q(\overline D) \subset \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \), is a continuous function from a compact space to a Hausdorff space.
		Further, \( q \) is injective on \( \overline D \) since the disc was contained entirely in a single hemisphere.
		The topological inverse function theorem (TIFT) states that a continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism.
		So \( q\restriction_{\overline D} \) is a homeomorphism from \( \overline D \) to \( q(\overline D) \).
		This then induces the homeomorphism \( q\restriction_{D} \) from the open disc \( D = {\overline D}^\circ \) to \( q(D) \).
		So by construction, \( [p] \in q(D) \); it has an open neighbourhood in \( \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \) which is homeomorphic to an open disc, concluding the proof.
	\end{proof}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	Let \( S^1 \) be the unit circle in \( \mathbb C \), and define the \textbf{torus} to be the product space \( S^1 \times S^1 \), with the subspace topology from \( \mathbb C^2 \) (identical to the product topology).
	\begin{lemma}
		The torus $ S^1 \times S^1 $ is a topological surface.
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
		Consider the map \( e \colon \mathbb R^2 \to S^1 \times S^1 \subset \mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{C} \) defined by
		\[
			(s,t) \mapsto \qty(e^{2\pi i s}, e^{2 \pi i t})
		\]
		That this induces a map \( \hat e \) from \( {\mathbb R^2}/{\mathbb Z^2} \), since \( e \) is constant under translations by \( \mathbb Z^2 \).
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\mathbb R^2 \arrow[d, "q"'] \arrow[r, "e"]             & S^1 \times S^1 \\
				{\mathbb R^2}/{\mathbb Z^2} \arrow[ru,dashed, "\hat e"] &
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		Under the quotient topology given by the quotient map \( q \), \( {\mathbb R^2}/{\mathbb Z^2} \) is a topological space.
		The map \( [0,1]^2 \to \mathbb R^2 \to {\mathbb R^2}/{\mathbb Z^2} \) is surjective, so \( {\mathbb R^2}/{\mathbb Z^2} \) is compact.
		So \( \hat e \) is a continuous map from a compact space to a Hausdorff space, and \( \hat e \) is bijective, so by TIFT \( \hat e \) is a homeomorphism.

		Note that we already have that \( S^1 \times S^1 \) is compact, Hausdorff and second countable (as a closed and bounded set in \( \mathbb C^2 \)), so it suffices to show it is locally homeomorphic to \( \mathbb R^2 \).

		As for the case of $S^2\to \mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^2$, take $\mathbf p\in \mathbb{R}^2, [\mathbf p]= q(\mathbf p)\in S^1\times S^1 $ and a small closed disc $ \bar{D}(\mathbf p)\in \mathbb{R}^2 $ such that 
		\[
			\forall	 (m,n)\neq (0,0)\in \mathbb{Z}^2, \overline{D}(\mathbf p) \cap (\overline{D}(\mathbf p)+(m,n)) = \varnothing. 
		\]
		Hence \( e\restriction_{\overline D(\mathbf p)} \) is injective and \( q\restriction_{\overline D(\mathbf p)} \) is injective.
		Now, restricting to the open disc as before, we can find an open disc neighbourhood of \( [\mathbf p] \).
		Since \( [\mathbf p] \) was chosen arbitrarily, \( S^1 \times S^1 \) is a topological surface.
	\end{proof}
	Another view point is that $ \mathbb{R}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}^2 $ is also given by imposing on $[0,1]^2$ the equivalence relation that 
\[
	(x,0) \sim (x,1),\ \forall 0\le x\le 1,\quad (0,y) \sim (1,y),\ \forall 0\le y\le 1.

	Assign letter names to each edge pair, and denote a polygon by the sequence of edges found when traversing in a clockwise orientation.
	The edge pair name is inverted if the edge is traversed in the reverse direction.
	Note the difference between the annotations on the first two shapes above, due to the reversed direction of the edge.

	If two edges \( e, \hat e \) are paired, this defines a unique Euclidean isometry from \( e \) to \( \hat e \) respecting the orientation, \( f_{e\hat e} \colon e \to \hat e \).
	The set of all such functions generate an equivalence relation on the polygon, identifying paired edges with each other.
	\begin{lemma}
		$P/\sim $ with quotient topology is a topological surface. 
	\end{lemma}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	The torus, defined here as \( T^2 = {[0,1]^2}/{\sim} \), is a topological surface.

	Let \( P \) be the polygon \( [0,1]^2 \).
	If \( p \) is in the interior of \( P \), then construct a sufficiently small disc that lies entirely within the interior.
	The quotient map is injective on the closure of the disc and is a homeomorphism on its interior.

	Let \( p \) be on an edge, but not a vertex.
	Let us say without loss of generality that \( p = (0,y_0) \sim (1,y_0) \).
	Let \( \delta \) be sufficiently small that the closed half-discs \( U, V \) centred on \( p \) with radius \( \delta \) do not intersect any vertices.
	Then we define a map from the union of the two half-discs to the disc \( B(0,\delta) \subseteq \mathbb R^2 \) via \( (x,y) \mapsto (x,y-y_0) \) or \( (x,y) \mapsto (x-1,y-y_0) \), which will be a bijective map.

	Recall the gluing lemma from Analysis and Topology: that if \( X = A \cup B \) is a union of closed subspaces, and \( f \colon A \to Y \), \( g \colon B \to Y \) are continuous, and \( f\restriction_{A \cap B} = g\restriction_{A \cap B} \), they define a continuous map on \( X \).

	Let \( f_U, f_V \) be the maps on the half-discs \( U, V \).
	By the definition of the quotient topology, \( q \circ f_U \) and \( q \circ f_V \) are also continuous.
	On the overlapping area, the functions \( q \circ f_U \) and \( q \circ f_V \) agree.
	Hence, by the gluing lemma, we can construct a function \( f \colon U \cup V \to B(0, \delta) \).

	Now the usual argument (pass to closed disk, use TIFT, and pass back to interior) shows that if \( [p] \in T^2 \) lies on the image of an edge in \( [0,1]^2 \), it has indeed a neighbourhood homeomorphic to a disc.

	Finally, all four vertices of the square are identified to the same point in the torus.
	A neighbourhood of each vertex can be identified with a quarter-disc in \( \mathbb R^2 \).
	We can repeatedly apply the gluing lemma to construct the whole disc \( B(0,\delta) \subseteq \mathbb R^2 \) and complete the argument as before. This proves our statement. 
\end{example}

We can generalise this proof to an arbitrary planar Euclidean polygon \( P \), such as the hexagon above.

The equivalence relation \( x \sim f_{e \hat e}(x) \) induces an equivalence relation on the vertices of \( P \), by considering the images of the vertices under all \( f_{e\hat e} \).
However, it is not necessarily the case that an equivalence class of vertices contains exactly four vertices, so quarter-discs are not necessarily applicable.
Again, there are three types of point:
\begin{itemize}
	\item interior points, for which a neighbourhood not intersecting the boundary is chosen;
	\item points on edges, for which a corresponding point exists and two half-discs can be glued to form the neighbourhood; and
	\item points on vertices.
		  For this case, all vertices of the polygon have a neighbourhood which is a sector of a circle.
		  Let there be \( r \) vertices in a given equivalence class.
		  Let \( \alpha \) be the sum of the angles of the sectors in a given class.
		  Any sector can be identified with a given sector in the disc \( B(0,\delta) \subseteq \mathbb R^2 \), which we will choose to have angle \( \alpha / r \).
		  Then, we can glue each sector together in \( \mathbb R^2 \), compatibly with the orientations of the edges and arrows, inducing a neighbourhood which is locally homeomorphic to a disc.
		  If \( r = 1 \), we have an equivalence class comprising a single vertex, which gives a single sector.
		  For \( r \) to be one, the two edges attached to this vertex must be paired and have the same direction (either both inwards or outwards from the vertex).
		  This quotient space is simply a cone, which is homeomorphic to a disc as required.
\end{itemize}
We can also show that the quotient space is Hausdorff and second countable.
By construction, two distinct points in the quotient space can be separated by open neighbourhoods by selecting a sufficiently small radius such that the discs considered in the derivation above are disjoint.
For second countability, consider
\begin{itemize}
	\item discs in the interior of \( P \) with rational centres and radii;
	\item for each edge of \( P \), consider an isometry \( e \to [0, \ell] \) where \( \ell \) is the length of \( e \), taking discs on \( e \) which are centred at rational values in \( [0,\ell] \); and
	\item for each vertex, consider discs centred at these vertices with rational radii.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}[Connected sums]
	Given topological surfaces \( \Sigma_1, \Sigma_2 \) we can remove an open disc from each and glue the resulting circles.
	Explicitly, we form a quotient relation on the disjoint union of the surfaces with the discs removed: 
	\[
		\theta\in \partial D_1 \sim \theta \in \partial D_2
	\]
	where $\theta$ parametrises $S^i=\partial D_i$, boundary of $D_i$ removed.
	This process is known as forming the \textbf{connect sum} of the surfaces, written \( \Sigma_1 \# \Sigma_2 \). In principle this depends on many choices and it takes some effort ot prove that it is well defined. 
	\begin{lemma}
		The connected sum of two topological surfaces is a topological surface.
	\end{lemma}

	The associated quotient space \( P/\sim  \) can be seen to be homeomorphic to a surface with two holes, known as a double torus.
	All vertices are identified as the same vertex in the quotient space.
	We can cut the octagon along a diagonal, leaving two topological surfaces which are homeomorphic to a torus.

	Thus, the connect sum of the two half-octagons are the connect sum of two toruses.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	Consider the following square.
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.7]
			\node (0) at (-2, -2) {};
			\node (1) at (2, -2) {};
			\node (2) at (0, -2) {};

	This is homeomorphic to the real projective plane \( \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \).
	This is because we identify points on the boundary with their antipodes, when interpreting the square as the closed disc \( B(0,1) \).
	The real projective plane was constructed by identifying points on the unit sphere with their antipodes.
	Thus, we can construct a homeomorphism by considering only points in the upper hemisphere (taking antipodes as required), and then orthographically projecting onto the \( xy \) plane.
	Under this transformation, points on the boundary are identified with their antipodes as required.
\end{example}

\subsection{Triangulation}\
 \vspace*{-1.5em}
\begin{definition}
	A \textbf{subdivision} of a compact topological surface \( \Sigma \) comprises
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item a finite subset \( V \subseteq \Sigma \) of vertices;
		\item a finite collection of edges \( E = \qty{e_i \colon [0,1] \to \Sigma} \) which are continuous injections on its interior and pairwise disjoint except perhaps at the endpoints in $ V $;
		\item we require that each connected component of the complement of \( V \cup E \) in \( \Sigma \) is homeomorphic to an open disc, and each such component will be called a \textbf{face}.
		      In particular, the boundary of each face has boundary inside the union of the edges and the vertices.
	\end{enumerate}
	We say that a subdivision is a \textbf{triangulation} if each closed face (closure of a face) contains exactly three edges, and two closed faces meet either at exactly one edge or not at any edges.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	A cube displays a subdivision of \( S^2 \).
	A tetrahedron displays a triangulation of \( S^2 \).
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	We can display subdivisions of surfaces constructed from polygons.

		\end{scope}

	The first of these examples is not a triangulation, since the two faces meet in more than one edge.
	The second is a triangulation.
\end{example}

\begin{note}
	The following is a very degenerate subdivision of \( S_2 \).
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}
		  \draw circle [radius=2];
		  \draw [name path=eqf] (-2, 0) arc(180:360:2 and 0.5);
		  \draw [dashed, name path=eqb] (-2, 0) arc(180:0:2 and 0.5);
		  \node [circ] at (0, 2) {};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	  \end{center}
	This has one vertex, no edges, and one face.
\end{note}

\subsection{Euler classification}\
\vspace*{-1.5em}
\begin{definition}
	The \textbf{Euler characteristic} of a subdivision is
	\[
		\# V - \# E + \# F
	\]
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item Every compact topological surface admits a subdivision (and indeed triangulations).
		\item The Euler characteristic is invariant under choice of subdivision, and is topologically invariant (depends only on the homeomorphism type of $\Sigma$). 
	\end{enumerate}
	Hence, we might say that a surface has a particular Euler characteristic, without referring to subdivisions.
	We write this \( \chi(\Sigma) \).
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
	It is not trivial to prove part (i).
	For part (ii), note that subdivisions can be converted into triangulations by constructing triangle fans.
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\node (0) at (-0.75, -1) {};
		\node (1) at (0.75, -1) {};
		\node (2) at (1.25, 0.5) {};
		\node (3) at (0, 1.5) {};
		\node (4) at (-1.25, 0.5) {};
		\draw (0.center) to (1.center);
		\draw (1.center) to (2.center);
		\draw (2.center) to (3.center);
		\draw (3.center) to (4.center);
		\draw (4.center) to (0.center);
		\draw [style=dashed] (0.center) to (3.center);
		\draw [style=dashed] (0.center) to (2.center);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	Triangulations can be related by local moves, such as
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.7]
		\node (0) at (-2.75, 1) {};
		\node (1) at (-0.75, 1) {};
		\node (2) at (-1.5, -1) {};
		\node (3) at (-3.5, -1) {};
		\node (4) at (1.5, 1) {};
		\node (5) at (3.5, 1) {};
		\node (6) at (2.75, -1) {};
		\node (7) at (0.75, -1) {};
		\node (9) at (-0.5, 0) {};
		\node (10) at (0.5, 0) {};
		\node (11) at (-0.75, 1) {};
		\draw (0.center) to (3.center);
		\draw (2.center) to (3.center);
		\draw (0.center) to (1.center);
		\draw (1.center) to (2.center);
		\draw (4.center) to (7.center);
		\draw (6.center) to (7.center);
		\draw (4.center) to (5.center);
		\draw (5.center) to (6.center);
		\draw [<->] (9.center) to (10.center);
		\draw [style=dashed] (11.center) to (3.center);
		\draw [style=dashed] (4.center) to (6.center);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	It is easy to check that both of these moves do not change the Euler characteristic.
	However, it is hard to make this argument rigorous, and it does not give much explanation for why the result is true.
	In Part II Algebraic Topology, a more advanced definition of the Euler characteristic is given, which admits a more elegant proof.
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
	The Euler characteristic of \( S^2 \) is \( \chi(S^2) = 2 \).

	For the torus, \( \chi(T^2) = 0 \).

	If \( \Sigma_1, \Sigma_2 \) are compact surfaces, then the connect sum \( \Sigma_1 \# \Sigma_2 \) can be constructed by removing a face of a triangulation, then gluing together the boundary circles (three edges) in a way that matches the edges.
	Then the connect sum inherits a subdivision, and we can find that it has Euler characteristic \( \chi(\Sigma_1 \# \Sigma_2) = \chi(\Sigma_1) + \chi(\Sigma_2) - 2 \), where the remaining term corresponds to the two faces that were removed; the changes of three vertices and three edges cancel each other.
	In particular, a surface \( \Sigma_g \) with \( g \) holes can be written \( \#_{i=1}^g T^2 \), so \( \chi(\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g \).
	We call \( g \) the \textbf{genus} of \( \Sigma \).
\end{example}

\section{Abstract smooth surfaces}
\subsection{Charts and atlases}
Recall that if \( \Sigma \) is a topological surface, any point lies in an open neighbourhood homeomorphic to a disc.
\begin{definition}
	A pair \( (U, \varphi) \), where $ U \subset \Sigma $ is open and $ \varphi:U\to V \subset \mathbb{R}^{2} $ is a homeomorphism is called a \textbf{chart}. The inverse \( \sigma = \varphi^{-1} \colon V \to U \) is called a \textbf{local parametrisation} for the surface.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	A collection of charts $ \{(U_i,\varphi_i)_{i\in I}\} $ such that $ \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i = \Sigma $ is called an \textbf{atlas} of $\Sigma$. 
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
	If \( Z \subseteq \mathbb R^2 \) is closed, \( \mathbb R^2 \setminus Z \) is a topological surface with an atlas containing one chart, \( (\mathbb R^2 \setminus Z, \phi = \iota) \).

	For \( S^2 \), there is an atlas with two charts, which are the two stereographic projections from the poles.
	We could consider alternative charts, for instance the projection to the \( yz \) plane, but this would be insufficient for describing the poles.
\end{example}
\begin{definition}
	Let \( (U_i, \varphi_i) \) be charts containing the point \( p \in \Sigma \), for \( i = 1, 2 \).
	Then the map
	\[
		\varphi_2 \circ\varphi_1^{-1}\restriction_{\varphi_1(U_1 \cap U_2)} \colon \varphi_1(U_1 \cap U_2) \to \varphi_2(U_1 \cap U_2)
	\]
	converts betwen the corresponding charts, and is called a \textbf{transition map}.
	This is a homeomorphism of open sets in \( \mathbb R^2 \).
\end{definition}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.7]{Geo1}
\end{center}

Recall from Analysis and Topology that if \( V \subseteq \mathbb R^n \) and \( V' \subseteq \mathbb R^m \) are open, then a continuous map \( f \colon V \to V' \) is called \textbf{smooth} if it is infinitely differentiable.
Equivalently, it is smooth if partial derivatives of all orders in all variables exist at all points.
If \( n = m \), then in particular the homeomorphism \( f \colon V \to V' \) is called a \textbf{diffeomorphism} if it is smooth and has smooth inverse.

\begin{definition}
	An \textbf{abstract smooth surface} is a topological space \( \Sigma \) together with an atlas of charts \( (U_i, \varphi_i) \) such that all transition maps \( \varphi_i \circ \varphi_j^{-1} \colon \varphi_j(U_i \cap U_j) \to \varphi_i(U_i \cap U_j) \) are diffeomorphisms.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	We could not simply consider a smoothness condition for \( \Sigma \) itself without appealing to atlases, since \( \Sigma \) is an arbitrary topological space and could have almost any topology.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
	The atlas of two charts with stereographic projections gives \( S^2 \) the structure of an abstract smooth surface.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	The torus \( T^2 = {\mathbb R^2}/{\mathbb Z^2} \). Recall that we obtained charts from (the inverse of) the projection restricted to small discs in $ \mathbb{R}^{2} $. We can find charts of all points by choosing sufficiently small discs in \( \mathbb R^2 \) such that they do not intersect any of their non-trivial integer translates.

	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{TorusChart1}
	\end{center}

	The transition maps for this atlas are all translations of \( \mathbb R^2 \).
	Hence \( T^2 \) inherits the structure of an abstract smooth surface.
	Explicitly, let us define \( e \colon \mathbb R^2 \to T^2 \) by \( (t,s) \mapsto \qty(e^{2\pi i t}, e^{2 \pi i s}) \), then consider the atlas
	\[
		\qty{(e\qty(D_\varepsilon(x,y)), e^{-1} \text{ on this image})}
	\]
	for \( \varepsilon < \frac{1}{3} \).
	These are charts on \( T^2 \), and the transition maps are (restricted to appropriate domains) translations in \( \mathbb R^2 \).
	Hence \( T^2 \), via this atlas, has the structure of an abstract smooth surface.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
	Let \( \Sigma \) be an abstract smooth surface, and \( f \colon \Sigma \to \mathbb R^n \) be a continuous map.
	We say that \( f \) is \textbf{smooth} at \( p \in \Sigma \) if, for all charts \( (U, \varphi) \) at \( p \) belonging to the smooth atlas for \( \Sigma \), the map
	\[
		f \circ \varphi^{-1} \colon \mathbb{R}^{2}\supset \varphi(U) \to \mathbb R^n
	\]
	is smooth at \( \varphi(p) \in \mathbb R^2 \).
\end{definition}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{SmoothFunction}
\end{center}

\begin{note}
	If it holds for one chart at $p$, it holds for all charts at $p$ by chain rule: $ f\circ \varphi_1^{-1} = f\circ \varphi_2^{-1} \circ (\varphi_2\circ \varphi_1^{-1}) $, where $ \varphi_2\circ \varphi_1^{-1} $ is a diffeomorphism. 
\end{note}

\begin{definition}
	Let \( \Sigma_1, \Sigma_2 \) be abstract smooth surfaces.
	A map \( f \colon \Sigma_1 \to \Sigma_2 \) is \textbf{smooth} if it is `smooth in the local charts'.
	Given a chart \( (U, \varphi) \) at \( p \) and a chart \( (V, \psi) \) at \( f(p) \) with $ f(U) \subset V $, both mapping to open subsets of \( \mathbb R^2 \), the map \( \psi \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1} \) is smooth at \( \varphi(p) \).
	Smoothness of \( f \) does not depend on the choice of chart, provided that the charts all belong to the same atlas.
\end{definition}
Again is $f$ is smooth at $p$, then smoothness of the local representation of $f$ at $p$ will hold for all charts at $p$ and $f(p)$ in the given atlases, again by chain rule.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{SmoothFunction2}
\end{center}
\begin{definition}
	Two surfaces \( \Sigma_1, \Sigma_2 \) are \textbf{diffeomorphic} if there exists a homeomorphism \( f \colon \Sigma_1 \to \Sigma_2 \) which is smooth and has smooth inverse.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	Often, we convert from a given smooth atlas for an abstract smooth surface \( \Sigma \) to the \textit{maximal compatible} smooth atlas.
	That is, we consider the atlas with the maximal possible set of charts, all of which have transition maps that are diffeomorphisms.
	This can be accomplished formally by use of Zorn's lemma.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Smooth surfaces in \( \mathbb R^3 \)}
Recall that if \( V \subseteq \mathbb R^n \) and \( V' \subseteq \mathbb R^m \), then \( f \colon V \to V' \) is smooth if it is infinitely differentiable.
\begin{definition}
	If \( Z \) is an arbitrary subset of \( \mathbb R^n \), we say that a continuous function \( f \colon Z \to \mathbb R^m \) is smooth at \( p \in Z \) if there exists an open ball \( p \in B \subseteq \mathbb R^n \) and a smooth map \( F \colon B \to \mathbb R^m \) which extends \( f \) such that they agree on \( B \cap Z \).
	In other words, \( f \) is locally the restriction of a smooth map defined on an open set.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
	Let \( X \subseteq \mathbb R^n \) and \( Y \subseteq \mathbb R^m \).
	We say that \( X \) and \( Y \) are \textbf{diffeomorphic} if there exists a continuous function \( f \colon X \to Y \) such that \( f \) is a smooth homeomorphism with smooth inverse.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	A \textbf{smooth surface in \( \mathbb R^3 \)} is a subset \(\Sigma \subset \mathbb R^3 \) such that for all points \( p \in \Sigma \), there exists an open subset \( p \in U \subseteq \Sigma \) that is diffeomorphic to an open set in \( \mathbb R^2 \).
	In other words, for all \( p \in \Sigma \), there exists an open ball \( p \in B \subseteq \mathbb R^3 \) such that if \( U = B \cap \Sigma \) and there exists a map \( F \colon B \to V \subseteq \mathbb R^2 \) such that \( {F}\restriction_U \colon U \to V \) is a homeomorphism, and the inverse map \( V \to U \subseteq \Sigma \subseteq \mathbb R^3 \) is smooth.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	Let \( \sigma \colon V \to U \) where \( V \subseteq \mathbb R^2 \) is open and \( U \subseteq \Sigma \subseteq \mathbb R^3 \) is open in \( \Sigma \), such that \( \sigma \) is a smooth homeomorphism and \( D \eval{\sigma}_x \) has rank 2 for all \( x \in V \).
	Then \( \sigma \) is called an \textbf{allowable parametrisation}.
	If \( \sigma(0) = p \), we say that \( \sigma \) is an allowable parametrisation \textbf{near} \( p \).
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
	For a subset \( \Sigma \subseteq \mathbb R^3 \), the following are equivalent.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item \( \Sigma \) is a smooth surface in \( \mathbb R^3 \);
		\item \( \Sigma \) is locally the graph of a smooth function, over one of the three coordinate planes: for all \( p \in \Sigma \) there exists an open ball \( p \in B \subseteq \mathbb R^3 \) and an open set \( V \subseteq \mathbb R^2 \) such that
		      \[
			      \Sigma \cap B = \qty{(x, y, g(x,y)) \colon g \colon V \to \mathbb R \text{ smooth}}
		      \]
		      or one of the other coordinate planes;
		\item \( \Sigma \) is locally cut out by a smooth function with non-zero derivative: for all \( p \in \Sigma \) there exists an open ball \( p \in B \subseteq \mathbb R^3 \) and a smooth function \( f \colon B \to \mathbb R \) such that
		      \[
			      \Sigma \cap B = f^{-1}(0);\quad D \eval{f}_x \neq 0
		      \]
		      for all \( x \in B \);
		\item \( \Sigma \) is locally the image of an allowable parametrisation near all points.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
	Part (b) implies that if \( \Sigma \) is a smooth surface in \( \mathbb R^3 \), each \( p \in \Sigma \) belongs to a chart \( (U, \varphi) \) where \( \varphi \) is (the restriction of) one of the three coordinate plane projections \( \pi_{xy}, \pi_{yz}, \pi_{xz} \) from \( \mathbb R^3 \) to \( \mathbb R^2 \).
	Consider the transition map between two such charts.
	If the two charts are based on the same projection such as \( \pi_{xy} \), then the transition map is the identity.
	If they are based on different projections \( \pi_{xy} \) and \( \pi_{yz} \), then the transition map is
	\[
		(x,y) \mapsto (x,y,g(x,y)) \mapsto (y,g(x,y))
	\]
	which has inverse
	\[
		(y,z) \mapsto (h(y,z),y,z) \mapsto (h(y,z),y)
	\]
	Hence all of the transition maps between such charts involve projection maps and the smooth maps involved in defining \( \Sigma \) as a graph.
	This gives \( \Sigma \) the structure of an abstract smooth surface.

Some of the relations given in the above theorem are easy to prove, but others come as a result of the inverse function theorem.
